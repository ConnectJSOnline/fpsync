Notice that I used ```and``` instead of ```&&```, this is because Unix uses ```&&``` and so we have to use ```and```.\n\n##Options\n\nAll of the options are preceded with ```--*``` so they don't conflict with any of the options for the commands you run.\n###Custom Glob\nThe ```--*glob=``` option lets you use custom globs to specify the files you want to watch. eye uses [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for file globbing.\n\nThis will watch all ```.json``` files in the current directory and any child directories:\n\n```\neye --*glob=**/*.json ls\n```\n\nHere is an example with two globs, it matches all ```.json``` files that are not in the ```node_modules``` directory:\n\n```\neye --*glob=**/*.json,%**/node_modules/** npm test\n```\n\n\nNote that I am using the ```%``` character in place of ```!```, this is because [Unix uses it](http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/doc/users_guide/2011.1/exclamation.html) and so we have to use ```%``` in the terminal and convert it to ```!```.\n\n####Continue\nUse the ```--*continue``` option to run commands without interuption.\n\nBy default, if eye is running a command and a file event occurs, eye will interrupt it and rerun the command. With this option, if a file event is triggered while a command is being run, the running command process won't be interrupted.\n\n####Queuing\nUse the ```--*queue``` option to have commands form a queue and be run one at a time until the queue is empty.\n\nWith this option, if eye is running a command and there are additional file change events, commands will be added to the queue. Once the initial command is finished, eye will execute the commands in the queue one by one until it has been emptied.\n\n###Verbose\nUse the ```--*verbose``` option to log useful information. This command:\n\n```eye --*verbose --*glob=index.js,*.json ls -a```\n\nWill log:\n\n```\npattern is:\n[ 'index.js', '*.json' ]\nwatched files:\n{ '/Users/colinwren/Projects/eye/':\n   [ '/Users/colinwren/Projects/eye/index.js',\n     '/Users/colinwren/Projects/eye/package.json' ] }\n```\n\nAnd when a file changes, the command will run and log:\n```\nrunning: ls -a\nresult:\n.\n..\n.git\n.gitignore\nLICENSE-MIT\nbin\nindex.js\nnode_modules\npackage.json\n```\n",
